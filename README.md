Huge-Number-Linked-List
=======================

Allow extremely large numbers to be stored. Creates a linked list of values, and can do basic arithmetic.

"2.  Although  the   longdata type can store large integers, it cannot store extremely large 
values such as an integer with 200 digits. Create aHugeNumberclass that uses a 
linked list of digits to represent integers of arbitrary length. The class should have 
a method to add a new most significant digit to the existing number so that longer 
and longer numbers can be created. Also add methods to reset the number and to 
return the value of the huge integer as aStringalong with appropriate constructor 
or accessor methods. Write code to test your class. 
Note:Use of a doubly linked list will make the next problem easier to implement. 

 3.  Add a copy constructor to the HugeNumber class described in the previous problem 
that makes a deep copy of the inputHugeNumber. Also create an addmethod that 
adds an inputHugeNumberto the instanceâ€™s HugeNumbervalue and returns a new 
HugeNumberthat is set to the sum of the two values. Write code to test the additions 
to your class. 

 4.  Give the definition of a generic class that uses a doubly linked list of data items. 
Include a copy constructor, anequalsmethod, a clonemethod, a toString
method, a method to produce an iterator, and any other methods that would 
normally be expected. Write a suitable test program."
